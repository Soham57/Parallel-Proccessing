# Parallel-Proccessing
**Problem Statement**

We are given a large text file that weights ~2.4GB and consists of 400,000,000 lines. Our goal is to find the most frequent character for each line.

You can use the following command in your terminal to create the input file:

Linux
yes Hello Python! | head -n 400000000 > input.txt

CMD
fsutil file createnew test.txt 52428800

echo "This is just a sample line appended  to create a big file. " > dummy.txt
for /L %i in (1,1,21) do type dummy.txt >> dummy.txt
